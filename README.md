  * Be able to use the device in any orientation
* Show a "history" view"
  * Add a new button labeled "History"
  * Segue to a new screen that contains a UIScrollView

    * each label should have a "history" of the most recent callculations
    * display as "2+2=4" "4/4=1" and so on
  * Have a button to return to the main display

#### Grading 
* 2 pts = AutoLayout functionality
* 2 pts = "History" screen
